labdoo-teambox
==============

Labdoo Non-Profit Organization flavor of Teambox3
Original Teambox3 project: https://github.com/teambox/teambox

This is not an official fork (it really should be), but since Teambox3 has become abandonware, we figured that at the present time it's more trouble than its worth to perform all the merges of the Labdoo specific code changes we made. A lot of this content is not functional and would not contribute to the stability or performance of the original project. Should it be requested or there are significant changes to the Teambox3 project, we will do a proper fork from Teambox3 and merge in our content on our fork.

Visit http://labdoo.org to learn about our organization!

Update (2/10/14):
=================
This fork will likely be deprecated by the end of February 2014, in favor of a fork of https://github.com/crewmate/crewmate, a more developed and actively maintained fork of the teambox3 project.
